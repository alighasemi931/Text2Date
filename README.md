Text-to-Date Format Conversion Model The objective of this project is to develop a model that converts various text-based representations of dates into a standardized date format. This includes converting inputs like "1 1403 ‫مهر‬" and " ‫سال‬ ‫مهر‬ ‫اول‬ 1403" into "1403/07/01" or "1403-07-01" into "1403/07/01." Goals and Objectives •Dataset Generation: Create a dataset containing pairs of informal date text and their corresponding formal date formats using language models like ChatGPT. •Model Training: Train a sequence-to-sequence model that can accurately convert informal date text into the formal date format.
